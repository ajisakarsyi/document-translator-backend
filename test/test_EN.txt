The development team at HorizonWorks Inc. has partnered with the German research institute Fraunhofer Gesellschaft to build an advanced robotics control platform. Utilizing ROS 2, Kubernetes, and NVIDIA Jetson modules, the project—codenamed Projekt Lichtblick—aims to enhance autonomous navigation in industrial environments. Regular Standup-Meetings are conducted in both English and German to accommodate the multinational team, and project milestones are tracked using Kanban methodologies inspired by Toyota’s original system.

Meanwhile, a separate initiative known as Cœur Digital is underway, spearheaded by Lumière Labs in collaboration with Tokyo-based 株式会社未来技術研究所. This project focuses on emotional AI and leverages models fine-tuned on Japanese kokoro expression datasets. Key technologies include Hugging Face Transformers, OpenCV, and the メディア芸術 API, which was developed for cultural data integration. Internal reviews are often conducted using the Japanese nemawashi process to ensure consensus before major decisions are made.
